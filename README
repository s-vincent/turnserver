TurnServer
==========

TurnServer is an OpenSource implementation of Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN). 
The connection to the server can be  UDP, TCP or TLS over TCP. It also supports STUN Binding method.

1) Build / install
------------------

TurnServer requires some libraries : 
- libconfuse development files;
- libssl development files;
- librt (normally included with Linux and *BSD).

TurnServer is written in pure C according to the C99 and POSIX + XSI standards. Thus it should be compiled on all POSIX systems which have realtime signals support.

Note for *BSD users : install the required libconfuse ports in /usr/ prefix, otherwise you have to set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable or make symlinks before running ./configure  

Type the following commands : 
$ aclocal
$ autoheader
$ autoconf 
$ automake --add-missing
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

You have to set a configuration file (see next section) before launching the server

Now you can launch the server : 
$ turnserver -c /path/to/config/file

TurnServer is known to work on the following systems :
- GNU/Linux 2.6;
- FreeBSD 7.0.

2) Configuration file
---------------------

In extra/ directory you will find a configuratin template file (turnserver.conf.template). Change settings according to your environment.

To authenticate the users, TurnServer uses (for the moment) a basic text file. The pathname can be configured with "account_file" parameter
in turnserver.conf file.

The format of each line is :
login:password:domain.org

If you want to use TLS over TCP you have to set "tls = true" in the configuration file as well as the pathnames of the certificates and private keys.
