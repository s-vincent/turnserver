.SH SYNOPSIS
.B %etc%/turnserver.conf
.sp

.SH DESCRIPTION
This is the TurnServer configuration file. 
.br
Here are the configuration options supported.

.SH OPTIONS

The file contains the following definitions:

.TP
.BR "listen_address " "=  IPv4 address"
The public IPv4 address of any relayed address (if not set, no relay for IPv4).

.TP
.BR "listen_addressv6 " "= IPv6 address"
The public IPv6 address of any relayed address (if not set, no relay for IPv6).

.TP
.BR "udp_port " "= number"
The UDP port of the server to listen for incoming connection.

.TP 
.BR "tcp_port " "= number"
The TCP port of the server to listen for incoming connection.

.TP
.BR "tls_port " "= number"
The TLS port of the server to listen for incoming connection.

.TP
.BR "tls " "= boolean"
Enable or not TLS over TCP connection.

.TP
.BR "daemon " "= boolean"
Run the program as daemon.

.TP
.BR "unpriv_user " "= string"
If the program is run as root or setuid root, the program will drop its privileges
to the unpriv_user privileges.

To use this feature, create a special user with the adduser command:
adduser --system --group turnserver

.TP
.BR "realm " "= string"
Realm value (i.e. domain.org).

.TP
.BR "nonce_key " "= string"
Key used to hash nonce.

.TP
.BR "max_relay_per_username " "= number"
Maximum number of allocation per username.

.TP
.BR "allocation_lifetime " "= number"
Lifetime of an allocation in second.

.TP
.BR "bandwidth_per_allocation " "= number"
Bandwidth limit for an allocation in KBytes/s.
0 value means disable bandwidth quota.

.TP
.nf
.BR "denied_address {"
.BR " address " "= IPv4 | IPv6 address"
.BR " mask " "= bitmask number"
.BR " port " "= number (1 - 65535)"
.B }
.fi

Defines an entry for the denied access list. This can appear multiple time. Format is defined as follow:
.br
.B address 
is a string representing an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
.br
.B mask
is a number representing the bitmask (i.e. 24 is similar as 255.255.255.0, ...).
.br
.B port
is a number representing the network port. The 0 value means all ports.

It is strongly recommended to restrict addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1 if there are private
services running on the TURN server.

.TP
.BR "ca_file " "= string"
The pathname of the Certification Authority certificate (required when tls=true).

.TP
.BR "cert_file " "= string"
The pathname of the server certificate (required when tls=true).

.TP
.BR "private_key_file " "= string"
The pathname of the server private key (required when tls=true).

.TP
.BR "account_method " "= [file | db | ldap ...]"
The method to retrieve account data.
Note that only the "file" method is implemented.

.TP
.BR "account_file " "= string"
The pathname of the account file (required when account_method=file).
